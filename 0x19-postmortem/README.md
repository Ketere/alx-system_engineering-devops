# ZABBIX SERVER OUTAGE POSTMORTEM
 * Author: Leonard Ketere

### ISSUE SUMMARY
 * On June 16th, 2024, from 9:00 PM to 10:15 pM EAT, our Zabbix monitoring server became unresponsive, leading to a complete loss of monitoring capabilities across our infrastructure. This outage impacted our ability to monitor system health and performance in real-time. The root cause was identified as the cache storage limit being reached due to rapid growth in monitored data.

### THE TIMELINE
 * 9:00 PM EAT :- Issue detected through an alert from our monitoring system indicating that the Zabbix server was unresponsive.
 * 9:04 PM EAT :- Initial investigation by the on-call engineer who confirmed that the Zabbix web interface was inaccessible.
 * 9:06 PM EAT :- Checked server logs and identified cache-related errors.
 * 9:10 PM EAT :- Restarted the Zabbix service, which temporarily resolved the issue but the server went down again within minutes.
 * 9:11 PM EAT :- Escalated to the DevOps team for a deeper investigation.
 * 9:15 PM EAT :- Misleading path investigated - checked network connectivity and firewall settings, all found to be normal.
 * 9:17 PM EAT :- Focused back on Zabbix server configuration and identified that the cache storage limit was reached.
 * 9:20 PM EAT :- Simulated the issue in a home lab by adjusting the cache size configuration in a Docker container environment.
 * 9:40 PM EAT :- Proposed the solution to increase the cache size and received approval from the management.
 * 10:00 PM EAT :- Implemented the solution by editing the cache size configuration and deploying it using Docker containers.
 * 10:15 PM EAT :- Zabbix server was back online and fully operational.

### ROOT CAUSE AND RESOLUTION
 * The primary cause of the outage was the exhaustion of cache storage capacity on the Zabbix server. As our company expanded its operations, the volume of monitored data exceeded the server's configured cache limits, leading to performance degradation and eventual unresponsiveness. To resolve this issue, I simulated the scenario in a controlled environment, confirming the cache limit as the culprit. After presenting the findings to management, we collectively decided to increase the cache size. The implementation was carried out using Docker containers, allowing for a scalable and flexible solution that could adapt to our growing needs.

### CORRECTION AND PREVENTATION MEASURES
 To prevent similar incidents in the future and enhance our monitoring infrastructure, the following steps will be implemented:
  * Automate cache size adjustments: Develop scripts to dynamically adjust cache sizes based on current and projected data volumes.
  * Implement advanced monitoring: Enhance existing monitoring tools to include predictive analytics for resource utilization.
  * Regular audits and simulations: Conduct periodic reviews and simulations to identify potential bottlenecks and scalability issues.
  * Documentation and training: Update internal documentation to reflect new configurations and provide training sessions for staff on managing scalable monitoring solutions.
